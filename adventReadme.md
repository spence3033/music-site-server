# Overview

I have been very excited to try implementing complete websites on my own, with a server, and a database. This software was to help teach me because eventually I want to make websites in my career.

This is a music website with a working login. Eventually it will display assignments, and allow music teachers to assign assignments to their students.

I've had a music teacher ask if I wanted to make a website for her buisness. So this was a work in progress to learn enough so I could do this for her. I also am learning this for future career skills.

# Development Environment

I used Vscode as my IDE environment.

I used the Angular framework.
Thie framework uses HTML, CSS, Typescript.

The server uses Express.js.

# Useful Websites
I used a course I bought on Udemy to work on this.

# Future Work
* Create an interactive page that allows teachers to assign assignments to students.
* Create a separate student page for progressing through assignments they have.
