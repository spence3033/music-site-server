# Overview

In this, I created a simple start of a website with a server. There isn't a lot of interaction but I plan to further work on this until I can use it for a future time to help music teachers.

The server, by the way is found at https://github.com/spence3033/Music-App.git. I made a different angular project with the server. When the server is pulled up in vscode, you run "node app.js". That will start it running.
Then to run the Web App you'll open the angular project on vscode and run "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json".

I wrote this software to learn how to work with a node.js server.

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

# Development Environment

I used Angular for the front-end work. Angular, by the way, is a framework that uses HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

I used Node.js for the server.

In angular I used a library with CSS styling in angular called Angular Materials. It helps speed up the styling process as it already has nice styles for buttons, inputs, dropdowns, and other things.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* So my front-end has a long way to go. But I spent a lot more of my time working on getting my types to pass from the server to TypeScript. I spent a couple hours debugging that problem, so I haven't put in as much time in the front-end. But that also wasn't the part I'm trying to learn.
* In the future I want the server to be connected to a database and verify the user bassed possible on a password. The admin/teacher will be able to add assignments to his/her students which will be saved in the database. And the students can see their assignments.
